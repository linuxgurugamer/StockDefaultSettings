This mod, Stock Default Settings, is designed to manage certain game config values which, while only accessable in a game, are actually global variables, and changing them in one save will affect all other saves in that install.

This can be a problem for someone who has multiple games (saves) going on in a single install.

This mod will allow these settings to be specific for each individual save, if desired.

Additionally, this mod has default settings which override the stock defaults.  These values are:


	NAME							Default Assigned	Stock			Description
										Value			Default
	HIGHLIGHT_FX						True			True			Highlight FX
	INFLIGHT_HIGHLIGHT					True			True			Part Highlighter Enabled in Flight
	TEMPERATURE_GAUGES_MODE				3				3				Temperature Gauges & Thermal Highlights
	CAMERA_DOUBLECLICK_MOUSELOOK		True			False			Double-Click Mouse Look
	ADVANCED_TWEAKABLES					True			False			Advanced Tweakables
	CONFIRM_MESSAGE_DELETION			True			True			Confirm Message Deletion
	ADVANCED_MESSAGESAPP				True			True			Advanced Message App
	EXTENDED_BURNTIME					True			False			Extended Burn Indicator
	ANTI_ALIASING						8 (8x)			2 (2x)			Anti-Aliasing
	TEXTURE_QUALITY						0 (Full res)	1 (Half res)	Texture Quality
