This mod, Stock Default Settings, is designed to manage certain game config values which, while only accessable in a game, are actually global variables, and changing them in one save will affect all other saves in that install.

This can be a problem for someone who has multiple games (saves) going on in a single install.

This mod will allow these settings to be specific for each individual save, if desired.

Additionally, this mod has default settings which override the stock defaults.  These values are:
